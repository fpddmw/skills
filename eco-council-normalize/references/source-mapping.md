# Source Mapping

## Public-Signal Mapping

### `gdelt-doc-search`

- Preferred use: topic recon and article-list retrieval.
- Output mapping:
  - article-like items -> `public_signal.signal_kind=article`
  - timeline bins -> `public_signal.signal_kind=timeline-bin`
- Claim generation:
  - article-like items can become `claim` candidates
  - timeline bins are stored for trend context but usually do not produce standalone claims

### `youtube-video-search`

- Treated as discovery/supporting context.
- Each kept video becomes one `public_signal`.
- Videos can contribute to claims when title/description contains mission-relevant assertions.

### `youtube-comments-fetch`

- Each kept comment/reply becomes one `public_signal`.
- Respect `reply_window_completeness`; do not treat reply counts as fully exhaustive historical coverage.

### `bluesky-cascade-fetch`

- Seed posts and thread nodes can both become `public_signal`.
- The normalizer stores post text, author, URI, timestamp, and lightweight engagement counts.

### `regulationsgov-comments-fetch`

- List fetch is good for trend discovery and ID capture.
- Comment text may be partial depending on API payload shape.

### `regulationsgov-comment-detail-fetch`

- Detail fetch is preferred when exact comment text matters.
- Attachment metadata is preserved in `metadata_json`.

### `gdelt-events-fetch`, `gdelt-mentions-fetch`, `gdelt-gkg-fetch`

- Current implementation ingests manifests and downloaded artifact provenance.
- These inputs are useful for later analytical joins, but they are not the primary claim-extraction path in this first deterministic build.

## Environment Mapping

### `open-meteo-historical-fetch`

- Produces point-based weather or soil series.
- Normalizer writes one staging row per timestamped metric value.
- Canonical output is one or more `observation` summaries per metric and location.

### `open-meteo-air-quality-fetch`

- Treated as modeled background air-quality context.
- Quality flags include `modeled-background`.

### `nasa-firms-fire-fetch`

- Writes one staging row per fire detection.
- Canonical output includes an `event-count` observation such as `fire_detection_count`.

### `openaq-data-fetch`

- API JSON results and CSV/CSV.GZ artifacts are both supported.
- Quality flags include `station-observation`.
- Prefer API for near-real-time windows and S3 for backfill windows.
