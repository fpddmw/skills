name: eco-council-orchestrate
description: Orchestrate eco-council multi-round runs around moderator task review, expert raw-data collection handoffs, deterministic normalization/reporting, and next-round scaffolding. Use when an OpenClaw-based eco-council needs one control-plane skill to bootstrap a run from mission JSON, prepare sociologist/environmentalist fetch prompts, run the shared data plane after raw artifacts land, or advance from one moderator decision to the next round safely.

# Eco Council Orchestrate

## Core Goal

- Keep OpenClaw agents in the control plane:
  - moderator reviews or revises `tasks.json`
  - sociologist and environmentalist fetch raw artifacts
  - deterministic scripts normalize, link, aggregate, and seed report drafts
- Bridge these phases with stable files:
  - round task review prompt
  - role-specific fetch prompts
  - fetch plan JSON
  - reporting handoff JSON

## Workflow

1. Bootstrap one run from an authored mission file.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_orchestrate.py bootstrap-run \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260321-chiangmai-smoke \
  --mission-input ./configs/chiangmai-mission.json \
  --pretty
```

2. Let the moderator review `round_001/moderator/tasks.json` through the generated prompt file:
- `round_001/moderator/derived/openclaw_task_review_prompt.txt`

3. Prepare one round after task review. This writes:
- `round_001/moderator/derived/fetch_plan.json`
- `round_001/sociologist/derived/openclaw_fetch_prompt.txt`
- `round_001/environmentalist/derived/openclaw_fetch_prompt.txt`

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_orchestrate.py prepare-round \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260321-chiangmai-smoke \
  --round-id round-001 \
  --pretty
```

4. Let the expert agents fetch raw artifacts into the exact `raw/` paths named by the prompt files.

5. Run the deterministic data plane after raw artifacts exist.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_orchestrate.py run-data-plane \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260321-chiangmai-smoke \
  --round-id round-001 \
  --pretty
```

6. Let OpenClaw experts revise the generated report drafts and let the moderator revise the decision draft through the prompt files produced by `$eco-council-reporting`.

7. Promote approved drafts, then scaffold the next round if the moderator decision says `next_round_required=true`.

```bash
python3 ../eco-council-reporting/scripts/eco_council_reporting.py promote-all \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260321-chiangmai-smoke \
  --round-id round-001 \
  --pretty

python3 scripts/eco_council_orchestrate.py advance-round \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260321-chiangmai-smoke \
  --round-id round-001 \
  --pretty
```

## Scope Decisions

- Use this skill for run lifecycle and handoff generation.
- Use `$eco-council-data-contract` for schema validation and round scaffolding.
- Use `$eco-council-normalize` for deterministic cleaning and linking.
- Use `$eco-council-reporting` for report packets, draft objects, and moderator decision seeding.
- Do not let this skill replace expert judgment inside OpenClaw.
- Do not let expert agents exchange raw payloads directly; normalize first.

## Special Capability

- `collect-openaq` wraps the multi-step OpenAQ chain:
  - nearby location discovery
  - sensor discovery
  - measurement fetch
  - aggregation into one normalizer-ready raw artifact

Use it directly when `openaq-data-fetch` needs a station-measurement artifact without pushing OpenAQ API chaining into the expert prompt.
