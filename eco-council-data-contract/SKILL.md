name: eco-council-data-contract
description: Define, validate, and scaffold shared data contracts for eco-council multi-agent runs, rounds, tasks, claims, observations, evidence cards, expert reports, and moderator decisions. Use when Codex needs to standardize data exchange between moderator, sociologist, environmentalist, and historian agents, create canonical JSON or SQLite schemas, or plan deterministic normalization before OpenClaw orchestration and case-retrieval RAG.

# Eco Council Data Contract

## Core Goal

- Keep one shared contract for the eco-council control plane and evidence plane.
- Validate mission, round-task, claim, observation, evidence-card, expert-report, and moderator-decision payloads before OpenClaw agents exchange them.
- Scaffold a repeatable run directory and initialize a canonical SQLite store for downstream normalization and linking.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the supported object kinds.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_contract.py list-kinds --pretty
```

2. Emit example payloads and adapt them before wiring OpenClaw.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_contract.py write-example \
  --kind mission \
  --output /tmp/eco-mission.json \
  --pretty
```

3. Validate one object or a list of objects.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_contract.py validate \
  --kind claim \
  --input /tmp/claims.json \
  --pretty
```

4. Scaffold one council run before connecting the moderator loop.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_contract.py scaffold-run \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260320-chiangmai-smoke \
  --run-id eco-20260320-chiangmai-smoke \
  --topic "Chiang Mai smoke verification" \
  --objective "Determine whether public smoke claims are supported by physical evidence." \
  --start-utc 2026-03-18T00:00:00Z \
  --end-utc 2026-03-19T23:59:59Z \
  --region-label "Chiang Mai, Thailand" \
  --point 18.7883,98.9853 \
  --pretty
```

5. Or scaffold the run directly from a fully authored `mission.json`.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_contract.py scaffold-run-from-mission \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260320-chiangmai-smoke \
  --mission-input ./configs/chiangmai-mission.json \
  --pretty
```

6. Scaffold the next round from `next_round_tasks` after moderator review.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_contract.py scaffold-round \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260320-chiangmai-smoke \
  --round-id round-002 \
  --tasks-input ./runs/20260320-chiangmai-smoke/round_001/moderator/next_round_tasks.json \
  --pretty
```

7. Initialize the canonical SQLite database used by the deterministic normalization layer.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_contract.py init-db \
  --db ./data/eco-council.db \
  --pretty
```

8. Validate the scaffolded bundle after agents or post-processors write files.

```bash
python3 scripts/eco_council_contract.py validate-bundle \
  --run-dir ./runs/20260320-chiangmai-smoke \
  --pretty
```

## Canonical Objects

- `mission`: moderator-owned run charter and shared window/region constraints.
- `round-task`: moderator-assigned work item for one expert role in one round.
- `claim`: sociologist-produced public or policy assertion that may need physical validation.
- `observation`: environmentalist-produced normalized measurement or event summary from one physical source.
- `evidence-card`: linked assessment between one claim and one or more observations.
- `expert-report`: per-role round report for sociologist, environmentalist, historian, or moderator.
- `council-decision`: moderator verdict for whether the round is sufficient or another round is required.

## Scope Decision

- Keep this skill focused on contracts, validation, scaffolding, and SQLite initialization.
- Do not fetch source data here.
- Do not perform geocoding, embedding, or RAG retrieval here.
- Do not let moderator or experts exchange raw skill payloads directly; normalize first, then pass canonical objects.

## OpenClaw Compatibility

- Let moderator, sociologist, environmentalist, and historian exchange only canonical files defined by this skill.
- Keep raw fetch outputs under `raw/` and canonical outputs under `normalized/` or `shared/`.
- Use moderator rounds externally in OpenClaw; this skill only scaffolds and validates round state.
- Use `scaffold-round` after moderator approval instead of mutating earlier round folders in place.
